	<p class="AboutDucks">Duck is the common name for numerous species of waterfowl in the family "Anatidae". Ducks are generally smaller and shorter-necked than swans and geese, which are also members of the same family. Ducks are mostly aquatic birds, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water.
