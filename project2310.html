	<h1>This is a website dedicated to ducks :)</h1>

	<p class="AboutDucks">Duck is the common name for numerous species of waterfowl in the family "Anatidae". 
	<br> Ducks are generally smaller and shorter-necked than swans and geese, which are also members of the same family.
	<br> They are mostly aquatic birds, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water.
